  aboutMe: 
    `I'm ${getAge()} years old and since I was a child, playing videogames was my favorite hobby. 
    Since I ever felt comfortable with computers and was the time for me to decide my job,
    I chose the IT area. I also like cooking and animes (specifically one piece üòÅ).`,
  principles: 
    `I think as languages as they are. Just tools. And every language is good to solve 
    specific problems. So I don't have any problem with working or learning another ones.
    I'm a visual person, so I don't think about stop working with frontend, but I
    consider being a full-stack developer, because I want to learn al least one backend
    driven language, maybe Python. I'm also very curious about mobile development. I've done some
    personal projects with ReactNative, but I'm sure that a professional experience with it would be great.
    I want to make life easier, happier and simpler to people.`
