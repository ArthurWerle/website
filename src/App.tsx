          And every language is good to solve 
    specific problems. So I don't have any problem with working or learning another ones.
    I'm a visual person, so for now, I don't think about stop working with frontend, but I
    consider being a full-stack developer, because I want to learn al least one backend
    driven language, maybe Python. I'm also very curious about mobile development. I've done some
    personal projects with ReactNative, but I'm sure that a professional experience with it would be great.
